## Description

This Android application, developed with XML and Kotlin, implements a RecyclerView adapter with a custom layout for the rows. The app allows users to add, update, delete tasks, as well as check and uncheck them as important. Interfaces are used to handle these interactions cleanly, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase. Additionally, the app implements SnackBars, providing quick feedback to the user. This project showcases modern Android development practices, including custom layouts, RecyclerView Adapters, Interface-based event handling, and user-friendly notifications with SnackBars.

## Features

- **Kotlin**: Used for developing the application's logic.
- **XML**: Used for designing the user interface.
- **Binding**: For efficient and safe access to UI components.
- **OOP**: Demonstrates object-oriented programming principles.
- **RecyclerView Adapter**: To efficiently manage and display a list of data items in a RecyclerView.
- **Custom Layout**: To design a custom row layout specifically for the adapter.
- **Interface**: To handle user interactions and provide a clean separation of concerns
- **Snackbar**: To provides a quick feedback to users triggered by click events.
